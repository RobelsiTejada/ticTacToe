Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Project plan: 4 cycles:
1st cycle - Front end (HTML and CSS)
2nd cycle - Functionality to game board (Javascript, JQuery, AJAX and Sass)
3rd cycle - Adding user creation/assignments and sign-in/sign-out (RestAPI)
4th cycle - Cleaning up code and final front end enhancements

Original wireframe: https://ibb.co/f89JPv

Unsolved Items:
-API connectivity is not fully functional
-Authemtication not defined
-When game is over empty boxes are still clickable
-Win count has not been instantiated

Future features:
-Game AI (ability to play against AI or another player(locally or remotely))
